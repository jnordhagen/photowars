# Project Description
Photo Wars is a web platform for user-submitted and user-voted photo humor, inspired by the popular subreddit [r/photoshopbattles](https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/). Photo Wars provides a centralized and streamlined interface for interacting with, sharing, and supporting photo comedy by allowing users to create and compete in a “photo war”, a low-stakes competition that has one user submitting an image for others to captions and submit photoshopped versions of the original. Submissions are immediately viewable by all users to be voted or commented on, and creators can gain points based on how well their submissions fare, creating a fun community based on hilarious visual gags.
